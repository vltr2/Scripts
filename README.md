# Scripts
Some scripts I've made to make my life easier

##ipmifans.py
This script is designed to run having data pulled from IPMI sdr list piped into it via grep for CPU it will look at the CPU and VRM temps and base fan speed off the highest of those temperatures.
I intended this to be run via a cron job once a minute or run with watch to be able to monitor the temps and fan speeds
